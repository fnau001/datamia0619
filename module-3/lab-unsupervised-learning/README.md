# Lab | Introduction to Machine Learning and ML Workflow


## Introduction

As a data analyst or data scientist, you will be given many open ended tasks. You will need to make sense of datasets where there isn't always a clear defined answer. This is where unsupervised learning is most useful.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to prepare a dataset for most scikit-learn algorithms.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
