# Lab | Continuous Probability Distributions


## Introduction

As a data analyst, you might need to use probability distribution for several reasons: 
- To analyze data to find useful patterns
- To make better data-driven decisions by answering questions like 'how likely it is that an observation of a random variable occurs'

## Getting Started

Open the `Lab Continuous Probability Distribution.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are exercises on uniform, normal, and exponential distributions. In each exercise please read the question carefully and provide your solutions below the question. All the calculations must be performed using Python. The dataset to be used in the exercise has been provided on GitHub here. Also please keep in mind that you might also need to use some of the functions you saw in the previous lessons. Please refer the notes. 
Happy Learning!!

## Deliverables

- `Lab Continuous Probability Distribution.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
