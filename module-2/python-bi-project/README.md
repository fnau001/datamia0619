# Guided Project: Business Intelligence with Python

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to apply the things that we have learned in the previous lessons in data visualizations with python and derive Business Intelligence insights. For this project, you will choose a data set and explore it using Python. You will put together a Story using different visualizations for presentation showing the insights you have derived from the data. You should demonstrate your proficiency using Python and the concepts you have learned throughout the chapter. 

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must construct a Story using visualizations consisting of at least 5 different plots for the data set you have chosen.
* Choose a different visualizations types for each of the 5 plots. Try to implement the concepts that we covered in the chapter (sorting, filtering, different , aggregations, etc.)
* You should create a Github repo for this project, and your data should be saved to that repo in a folder named data.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took, your thought process as you built your visualizations
* Store the jupyter workbook in the repo
* Save the plots in a powerpoint presentation. Check the last section on this page - "Things you might want to talk about" to see what other content you would want to have on your powerpoint slides. Upload the powerpoint in your repo as well

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A Jupyter workbook uploaded to Git Hub** that contains the visualizations you created from your data set.
* **A data folder** containing the data set you used for your project.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualizations and organizing them into a Story as well as your results, obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and a link to your completed Tableau workbook.
* **A ``MyStory,ppt`` file** containing snapshots of your data visualizations

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Find a data set to process** - a great place to start looking would be [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) and [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
* **Explore the data set** and come up with a variety of visualizations that you can potentially include in your story.
* **Break the project down into different steps** - identify the entities/dimensions in your data set, explore them each individually, and then progress to analyzing different combinations of them.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - the concepts and methods you have learned in the business intelligence chapter as well as some of the things you've learned in previous chapters. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.


## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectactions, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 6 minutes
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 9 minutes

### Attire

* DRESS TO IMPRESS: [Smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) would be great

### Outputs

* A powerpoint presentation
* The presentation will be executed on a class computer (instead of your own)
* Get ready to explain your data set and visualizations

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* A hobby you have.
  * __Note: we are getting you ready for final presentation!__
* Elevator pitch:
  * The data set you chose.
  * Why did you chose that data set?
  * The most important thing you learned.
* One technical challenge you faced:
  * Explain the challenge.
  * Explain how and what you did to overcome it.
* Busines Intelligence Walkthrough:
  * Walk the audience through the data set you chose, providing an overview of some of the fields and other information contained in the data.
  * Walk the audience through your process of designing and constructing your visualizations and your Tableau Story including what techniques you employed, what avenues you decided to pursue and why, and what lessons you learned.
* One important mistake you made:
  * Did you made a mistake in the construction of your visualizations? Did you aggregate a field incorrectly?
