# Lab | Introduction to BI and Tableau

## Introduction

In this lab, we will practice loading data into Tableau, inspecting and modifying data types, and coming up with appropriate metrics or KPIs based on the information contained in the data set. We will be working with a [liquor store sales data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pQ2VFsuuwLqBstYYTY3fcZY32WLigw3Pzxnikkce6IA/edit?usp=sharing) hosted in Google Sheets.

## Getting Started

Follow each of the steps below, recording your answers where appropriate in the `main.md` file located in the `your-code` directory.

1. Open the [data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pQ2VFsuuwLqBstYYTY3fcZY32WLigw3Pzxnikkce6IA/edit?usp=sharing) in a browser.
2. Add the data set to your Google Drive.
3. Launch the Tableau Public application.
4. Import the data set from Google Sheets into Tableau.
5. Once the data set has been imported, inspect the data types for each field. Are there any that are incorrect? What should they be changed to?
6. Change the field data types you identified as incorrect to the correct data type.
7. From the fields in the data set, come up with 5 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that would help provide the company insight into its performance. You don't need to actually create the KPIs at this point, just list what they are.
8. What additional fields could be created from the existing fields that would be informative?

## Deliverables

- `main.md` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
