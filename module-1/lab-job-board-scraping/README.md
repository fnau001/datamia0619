# Lab | Web Scraping - LinkedIn Job Board Scraping

## Introduction

As you have learned in the lesson, Web "scraping" (also called "web harvesting", "web data extraction" or even "web data mining"), can be defined as "the construction of an agent to download, parse, and organize data from the web in an automated manner". Or, in other words: instead of a human end-user clicking away in their web browser and copy-pasting interesting parts into, say, a spreadsheet, web scraping offloads this task to a computer program which can execute it much faster, and more correctly, than a human can. 

Data scientists have often found web scraping to be a powerful tool to have in their arsenal, as many data science projects starts with the first step of obtaining an appropiate data set, so why not utilize the information the web provides?

In this lab, you will practice a series of exercises to test your web scraping skills. You will work on your own but remember the teaching staff is at your service whenever you encounter problems.

## Getting Started

Open the `lab-code-web-scraping-linkedIn.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. This is a guided lesson where we will scrape some information such as company name, position/title, salary offering, and description.  

## Deliverables

- `lab-code-web-scraping-linkedIn.ipynb` with your responses. 

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
